## Lab interests
The Goncalves laboratory is interested in understanding the processes of somatic and regulatory genome evolution during ageing and early carcinogenesis. We are developing multiple projects that combine deep DNA and single-cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics with functional analysis and comparative genomics with the goal of understanding how the perturbation of genetic sequences can lead to the development of tumours. We also develop computational methods for novel technologies.

          <div class="card-text text-black-50" width="500">Collaborative project on identifying drivers of tumour-suppressive micro-environments. It addresses the question of why some organisms, including many humans, never develop cancer in their lifetime. To address this, we are using model organisms with high natural cancer resistance and exceptional longevity such as the naked mole-rat and Ansellâ€™s mole-rat.</div>
