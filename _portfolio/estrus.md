## Description
Organs from the female reproductive tract (FRT) in C57BL/6 mice were sampled. Experimental timepoints were 3 months old mice across all four estrus phases, pregnant (decidualized) and aged (18 months, acyclic) mice. A total of 483,611 cells were sequenced using the 10X Chromium Gene Expression technology.
